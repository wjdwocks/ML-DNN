In this section, we provide an overview of the theoretical foundations underlying the proposed method. The main topics covered include the extraction of Persistence Images via Topological Data Analysis, the transformation process for Gramian Angular Field images, and the fundamentals of Knowledge Distillation.

\Subsection{Topological Data Analysis}
Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a mathematical approach designed to extract global topological patterns from complex and high-dimensional data structures. It characterizes data by capturing topological properties such as loops and connectivity. Traditional signal processing methods often struggle with noise interference and have limited ability to interpret global features. In contrast, TDA excels at identifying these global characteristics and demonstrates robustness even when the data contains noise【Reference】. Due to these advantages, TDA is particularly effective for analyzing intricate and noisy datasets.

The application of TDA begins with converting raw one-dimensional signal data into a high-dimensional point cloud representation【Reference】. This transformation is typically performed using a sliding window embedding technique, where sequential segments of the signal are extracted and mapped into a higher-dimensional space. Each segment is thus represented as a point reflecting temporal patterns, and collectively, the resulting point cloud encodes the temporal relationships inherent in the original signal【Reference】.

Next, persistent homology is computed from the constructed point cloud. This step commonly employs the Vietoris-Rips method to build simplicial complexes【Reference】. Points within a certain radius are connected, and as this radius gradually increases—a process known as filtration【Reference】—topological features such as connected components, loops, and cavities emerge (birth) and disappear (death). The lifespan of these features is summarized in a Persistence Diagram (PD), which effectively encodes the intrinsic structure of the data, thereby providing robustness. However, a limitation of PDs is their irregular and variable size, which hinders direct integration with machine learning algorithms. To address this, Persistence Diagrams are transformed into Persistence Images (PI) by mapping each PD point onto a discretized grid weighted by Gaussian kernels. This results in fixed-size representations that are well-suited for downstream machine learning tasks.
