\subsection{4.2.1}
[confusion matrix] : [Sig(단일), Sig to Sig(1T), PI+Sig to Sig(2T), GAF+Sig to Sig(2T)]의 4개인데, base로 해도 상관 없다. 각 Confusion Matrix를 보며, Signal to Sig의 경우 어떤 클래스들(이러이러한 행동들임)에 대해서 혼동하는 것을 볼 수 있었고, GAF는 이러한 클래스들(이러이러한)것을 잘 하지만, 어떤 것은 혼동하고, PI는 이러이러함을 볼 수 있었다.

\subsection{4.2.2} - Teacher 다른조합.
We conducted additional experiments to investigate the effect of architectural differences between teachers in the multi-teacher setting. In this subsection, we keep the base architecture as WideResNet and vary its depth and width to form different teacher configurations. As shown in Table 7, the experiments were performed under three conditions: Depth-wise, where only the depth of the two teacher models differs; Width-wise, where only the width differs; and Depth+Width-wise, where both depth and width differ simultaneously.

Table \ref{table:} compares the PI–signal and GAF–signal teacher combinations under different architectural settings. In both combinations, Ann achieves higher accuracy than Base, and the GAF–signal combination generally outperforms the PI–signal combination. In addition, Table 6 shows that there are no substantial performance differences across the depth, width, and depth+width settings, suggesting that architectural mismatches between teachers do not have a significant impact on student performance.
