[confusion matrix] : [Sig(단일), Sig to Sig(1T), PI+Sig to Sig(2T), GAF+Sig to Sig(2T)]의 4개인데, base로 해도 상관 없다. 각 Confusion Matrix를 보며, Signal to Sig의 경우 어떤 클래스들(이러이러한 행동들임)에 대해서 혼동하는 것을 볼 수 있었고, GAF는 이러한 클래스들(이러이러한)것을 잘 하지만, 어떤 것은 혼동하고, PI는 이러이러함을 볼 수 있었다.

\subsection{4.2.2} - Teacher 다른조합.
Table 7 presents the results of experiments conducted in the multi-teacher setting, where the two teachers have different network architectures. The experiments were performed under three conditions: the case where only the depth of the two teacher models differs (Depth-wise), the case where only the width differs (Width-wise), and the case where both depth and width differ simultaneously (Depth+Width-wise).

For the PI–signal combination, Ann consistently outperforms Base across all architecture configurations, demonstrating its robustness to variations in teacher structure. Notably, matching the depth or width between the two teachers does not guarantee superior performance compared to other configurations, indicating that architectural alignment in a single dimension does not necessarily translate into better knowledge transfer.

For the GAF–signal combination, a similar trend is observed: Ann generally achieves higher accuracy than Base in most settings, regardless of the specific depth–width pairing. As with the PI–signal case, no clear pattern emerges that associates Depth-wise, Width-wise, or Depth+Width-wise configurations with systematically higher or lower performance. These results suggest that the proposed annealing initialization maintains its advantage even when the two teachers differ substantially in both architectural design and representational characteristics.
