\subsection{4.2.1}
We present the experimental results on three datasets: GENEActiv with 14 classes (Table 4), GENEActiv with 7 classes (Table 5), and PAMAP2 (Table 6). Each table reports the classification accuracy of the student model under different knowledge distillation strategies and teacher–student configurations.
In the multi-teacher configurations, three variants are compared. AVER sets the distillation loss weights for both teachers equally, ensuring an unbiased contribution from each teacher. Base uses the dataset-specific distillation loss weight values described in Section 4.1.2. Ann applies the proposed annealing initialization to the Base configuration.

Table 4 shows that Ann generally outperforms AVER and Base. The combination of raw time-series signals with GAF image representations achieves higher accuracy than the combination of raw time-series signals with PI, as GAF effectively captures the periodic patterns inherent in human activities. Furthermore, teachers with architectures closer to that of the student tend to yield better performance than those with much larger capacities. [마지막 문장 수정중.]

Table 5 uses the same hyperparameters as in the 14-class experiments and considers only the teacher combination of WRN16-1 and WRN16-3. In the 7 class setting, Ann achieves the highest accuracy among all compared strategies. Additionally, we evaluate two different window sizes when segmenting the data: 500 and 1000. The results show that the 1000-window setting yields higher accuracy, which can be attributed to the larger amount of information contained in each sample.

Table 6 shows that Ann achieves the highest or near-highest performance in most modality combinations. In particular, the combination of GAF images with raw signals outperforms the PI–signal conbination, even though the standalone PI-based teacher has a higher baseline accuracy than the GAF-based teacher. This suggests that, in human activity classification tasks, GAF provides more effective complementary information to the raw signal. Furthermore, the results indicate that smaller architectural differences between the teacher and the student lead to better knowledge transfer and higher overall accuracy.
